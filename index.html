<p><i>I don't know your name, but I know you very well. We both do, a lot of time watching each other. A lot of time watching, analizing, and interpreting every gesture of that weird enemy who happens to be our seemingly inevitable companion for about an hour, most days. How long has it been? Can you remember? I definitely can't, but I'm sure it's been enough for us to understand that we lie in the opposite side of a good portion of that we call life, as sometimes happens with some kind of men.</i></p>
